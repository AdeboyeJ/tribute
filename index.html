    <h1><hr>Welcome<hr></h1>
    </div>
    <p>Thank you all for coming to help us celebrate Liza's life and share our grief at her passing.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Carol, and Liza and I have been best friends since childhood. We lived just five houses apart on National Avenue, and we spent part of nearly every day together as kids.</p>

    <h2>Memories</h2>
    <p>When I think of Liza as a child, I remember how much she loved exploring the ravine behind our house. Half of our summers were spent wandering through the woods, looking for crayfish under rocks along the creek, climbing trees, and generally doing things that would have given our parents gray hair much sooner if they knew what we had been up to each day.

        I have to share one memory that really illustrates Liza's fearless, and sometimes impulsive, nature. Some of the neighborhood boys had built a rope swing in a tree along the ravine's edge. Liza, being fearless, decided to give it a try.
        
        As she swung out over the edge, one of the boys jokingly called out, "Jump!" My heart leaped to my throat as I saw Liza let go of the rope on her next swing out. Luckily she wound up with nothing more than skinned knees and a sheepish grin that said she couldn't believe she had just done that, but it just goes to show what a risk taker she was.
        
        More than a simple risk taker, Liza also had a generous soul, as I'm sure many of you here this morning can attest to. She never met a person in need that she didn't find some way of helping. Her work as director of our local family shelter became her greatest passion, and she put in tireless hours organizing meals and places where "her families" could all stay together until they could get back on their feet. I say, "her families" with all seriousness because she didn't just take them into shelters; she really took them into her heart and kept contact with them even after their lives were back on track.</p>
    <h2>Mention of Family and Friends</h2>
    <p>When you combine the facts that Liza was a compassionate soul and willing to take risks, it's not difficult to understand why she ventured out in that terrible snowstorm on Wednesday night to try to take food and diapers to one of her families in need. Yes, maybe they would have been alright until morning, but that wasn't how Liza would have thought about it. She would have worried about their empty stomachs and imagined the sound of that baby's crying. She would have set any thoughts for her safety aside and gone to their aid, and that's exactly what she did.

        Of course, we now know that she never made it to that family. We can second guess Liza's decision with 20/20 hindsight, or we can embrace the fact that she died doing something she believed in so deeply. Knowing her as I did, I can tell you that her only regret about her decision to go out on the road that night would have been that her husband, Mitch, is now left to carry on without her. As passionate as she was about her shelter work, Mitch was truly the love of her life.
        
        It may comfort us all a bit to realize that Liza is now reunited with her beloved parents, Lee and Meredith, and that someday we'll all be together again when we cross over to the other side. This is only a brief parting in the larger scheme of life.</p>
    <h2>Closing</h2>
    <p>One thing you may or may not know is that Liza was a huge fan of the band Queen. She particularly loved a song called Dear Friends, and she once made me promise that if she passed before I did, I would play the song at her memorial, or at least read the lyrics. So, I'll read those now in closing, and I hope they leave you with the message that time will heal our wounds, and that life truly does go on.</p>
